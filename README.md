# ijo
A programming language without keywords.

# Disclaimer
ijo is **NOT** trying to be as performant as C/C++. It is entirely made entirely to learn how different programming languages and paradigms are implemented and to experiment on my own ideas of what a programming language can look like.

Expect breaking changes without notice.

# Initial inspiration
The inspiration for this project is the Lox programming language and the book by its author: [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).
