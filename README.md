# ijo
A simple dynamically typed language built with the Beef programing language.

The inspiration for this project is the Lox programming language and the book by its author: [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

ijo is **NOT** trying to be as performant as C/C++. It is entirely made entirely to learn how different programming languages and paradigms are implemented and to experiment on my own ideas of what a programming language can look like.
